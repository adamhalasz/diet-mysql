# **diet-mysql**
A diet plugin for the most popular mysql nodejs driver:
[https://github.com/felixge/node-mysql][1]

## **Features**
- Simplifies connecting to mysql
- Creates a mysql wrapper for diet that can be used in local diet routes.
- the `connection.end()` is called automatically on `$.end()` so you don't have to.
- Very small, just 20kb

## **Install**
```
npm install diet-mysql
```

## **Usage**
```js
// Require Diet
var server = require('diet')

// Create App
var app = new server()

// Configure Domain
app.domain('http://example.com/')

// Setup MySQL
var mysql = app.plugin('diet-mysql')
var db = mysql.db({ database:'test' })

// Start the Application
app.start()

// Listen on GET / and use the `db` plugin for this route
app.get('/', db, function($){
    $.db.query('SELECT * FROM accounts', function(err, accounts){
		$.data.accounts = accounts
		$.html()
	})
})
```

## **One Liner**
If you only need to use one database, you can shorten your call to:
```js
var db = app.plugin('diet-mysql').db({ database: 'test' })
```

## **Methods**
The plugin returns a few methods when you call it:

**mysql.db**
The `database` paremeter is required everything else is optional.
```js
// api
var db = mysql.db(database, port, host, protocol)
```
```js
// example - with the defaults
var db = mysql.db({
	host     : 'localhost',
	user     : 'root',
	password : '',
	database : 'test'
})
```

**mysql.class**
This is a shortcut for the return values of `require('mysql')` inside `diet-mysql`.
